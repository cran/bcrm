\title{Plot the estimated dose-toxicity curve}
\usage{
\method{plot}{bcrm}(x, file = NULL, each = FALSE, trajectory = FALSE,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class "bcrm",  as returned by \code{\link{bcrm}}}

\item{file}{File name where the dose-response plots are stored,  in a pdf
format. The program will amend the current sample size to the end of the
file name.}

\item{each}{Should posterior summaries be plotted after each recruited
cohort? Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{trajectory}{Should the sequential dose trajectory of the recruited
patients be plotted,  along with the observed toxicities? Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods}
}
\description{
The estimated dose-toxicity curve using the Bayesian continuous reassessment
method is plotted for the patients thus far recruited into the trial
}
\details{
The estimated 2.5\%,  25\%,  50\%,  75\%,  97.5\% quantiles of the probability
of toxicity are plotted for each dose. Additionally,  a histogram of the
number of toxicities and non-toxicities is plotted at each experimented
dose.

If \code{trajectory = TRUE} then the sequential dose trajectory and observed
toxicities are plotted.
