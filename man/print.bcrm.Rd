\title{Print information regarding a trial conducted using the Bayesian continuous
reassessment method}
\usage{
\method{print}{bcrm}(x, tox.cutpoints = NULL, trajectories = FALSE,
  threep3 = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class "bcrm" or "bcrm.sim" as returned by
\code{\link{bcrm}}}

\item{tox.cutpoints}{An optional argument passed to \code{print.bcrm.sim}
specifying the cutpoints of toxicity for which the operating characteristics
are to be categorised. Defaults to \code{seq(from=0, to=1, by=0.2)}}

\item{trajectories}{Should the individual simulation dose and outcome
trajectories be returned? Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{threep3}{Should operating characteristics of a standard 3+3 rule-based
design be displayed alongside those from the \code{bcrm} design? Defaults to
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods}
}
\value{
The following two components are returned from
\code{print.bcrm.sim}: \item{exp}{A matrix with number of rows equal to the
number of doses,  and number of columns equal to the number of simulations.
Gives the experimentation proportions for each dose within each simulation.}
\item{rec}{A vector with length equal to the number of simulations,  giving
the recommended MTD for each simulation.}
}
\description{
Print method for a trial or series of trials conducted using a
\code{\link{bcrm}} model.
}
\details{
If a single trial is conducted,  then the \code{\link{print}} function
currently produces summary information about the design used,  the data
observed,  current posterior estimates of toxicity,  and the next recommended
dose level.  If a simulation study is conducted,  then the following
operating characteristics are printed: \describe{ \item{Experimentation
proportion}{Proportion of patients recruited to each dose,  and to each true
region of toxicity,  across the simulated trials} \item{Recommendation
proportion}{Proportion of trials that recommend each of the dose levels as
the final maximum tolerated dose (i.e. with toxicity "closest" to the target
toxicity level),  and the associated regions of true toxicity for the
recommended MTDs} } If \code{trajectories = TRUE} then the dose level
administered and outcome observed are returned as matrices for every patient
(column) in every simulation (row).  If \code{threep3 = TRUE} then the
operating characteristics of the standard 3+3 design are displayed alongside
those of the \code{bcrm} design (see \code{\link{threep3}} for more
details).
