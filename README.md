bcrm
====

Implements a wide variety of one and two-parameter Bayesian CRM designs. The program can run interactively, allowing the user to enter outcomes after each cohort has been recruited, or via simulation to assess operating characteristics.

Installation
------------

You can install from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("bcrm")
```

Or try the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mikesweeting/bcrm")
```

Example
-------

``` r
library(bcrm)

## Dose-escalation cancer trial example as described in Neuenschwander et al 2008.
## Pre-defined doses
dose<-c(1,2.5,5,10,15,20,25,30,40,50,75,100,150,200,250)
## Pre-specified probabilities of toxicity
## [dose levels 11-15 not specified in the paper, and are for illustration only]
p.tox0<-c(0.010,0.015,0.020,0.025,0.030,0.040,0.050,0.100,0.170,0.300,0.400,0.500,0.650
  ,0.800,0.900)
## Data from the first 5 cohorts of 18 patients
data<-data.frame(patient=1:18,dose=rep(c(1:4,7),c(3,4,5,4,2)),tox=rep(0:1,c(16,2)))
## Target toxicity level
target.tox<-0.30
## Random seed set to 12345 for this example
seed<-12345

## Simulate 10 replicate trials of size 36 (cohort size 3) using this design 
## with constraint (i.e. no dose-skipping) and starting at lowest dose
## True probabilities of toxicity are set to pre-specified probabilities (p.tox0)
